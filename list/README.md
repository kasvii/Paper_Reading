1. Keep it SMPL: Automatic Estimation of 3D Human Pose and Shape from a Single Image

   *ECCV, 2016* [[Paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08128) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       We describe the first method to automatically estimate the 3D pose of the human body as well as its 3D shape from a single unconstrained image. We estimate a full 3D mesh and show that 2D joints alone carry a surprising amount of information about body shape. The problem is challenging because of the complexity of the human body, articulation, occlusion, clothing, lighting, and the inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D from 2D. To solve this, we first use a recently published CNN-based method, DeepCut, to predict (bottom-up) the 2D body joint locations. We then fit (top-down) a recently published statistical body shape model, called SMPL, to the 2D joints. We do so by minimizing an objective function that penalizes the error between the projected 3D model joints and detected 2D joints. Because SMPL captures correlations in human shape across the population, we are able to robustly fit it to very little data. We further leverage the 3D model to prevent solutions that cause interpenetration. We evaluate our method, SMPLify, on the Leeds Sports, HumanEva, and Human3.6M datasets, showing superior pose accuracy with respect to the state of the art.

2. General Automatic Human Shape and Motion Capture Using Volumetric Contour Cues

   *ECCV, 2016* [[Paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08659) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Markerless motion capture algorithms require a 3D body with properly personalized skeleton dimension and/or body shape and appearance to successfully track a person. Unfortunately, many tracking methods consider model personalization a different problem and use manual or semi-automatic model initialization, which greatly reduces applicability. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic algorithm that jointly creates a rigged actor model commonly used for animation - skeleton, volumetric shape, appearance, and optionally a body surface - and estimates the actor's motion from multi-view video input only. The approach is rigorously designed to work on footage of general outdoor scenes recorded with very few cameras and without background subtraction. Our method uses a new image formation model with analytic visibility and analytically differentiable alignment energy. For reconstruction, 3D body shape is approximated as Gaussian density field. For pose and shape estimation, we minimize a new edge-based alignment energy inspired by volume raycasting in an absorbing medium. We further propose a new statistical human body model that represents the body surface, volumetric Gaussian density, as well as variability in skeleton shape. Given any multi-view sequence, our method jointly optimizes the pose and shape parameters of this model fully automatically in a spatiotemporal way.

3. Unite the people: Closing the loop between 3d and 2d human representations

   *CVPR, 2017* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lassner_Unite_the_People_CVPR_2017_paper.html) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       3D models provide a common ground for different representations of human bodies. In turn, robust 2D estimation has proven to be a powerful tool to obtain 3D fits "in-the-wild". However, depending on the level of detail, it can be hard to impossible to acquire labeled data for training 2D estimators on large scale. We propose a hybrid approach to this problem: with an extended version of the recently introduced SMPLify method, we obtain high quality 3D body model fits for multiple human pose datasets. Human annotators solely sort good and bad fits. This procedure leads to an initial dataset, UP-3D, with rich annotations. With a comprehensive set of experiments, we show how this data can be used to train discriminative models that produce results with an unprecedented level of detail: our models predict 31 segments and 91 landmark locations on the body. Using the 91 landmark pose estimator, we present state-of-the art results for 3D human pose and shape estimation using an order of magnitude less training data and without assumptions about gender or pose in the fitting procedure. We show that UP-3D can be enhanced with these improved fits to grow in quantity and quality, which makes the system deployable on large scale. The data, code and models are available for research purposes.

4. HMR: End-to-end recovery of human shape and pose

   *CVPR, 2018* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Kanazawa_End-to-End_Recovery_of_CVPR_2018_paper.html) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       We describe Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), an end-to-end framework for reconstructing a full 3D mesh of a human body from a single RGB image. In contrast to most current methods that compute 2D or 3D joint locations, we produce a richer and more useful mesh representation that is parameterized by shape and 3D joint angles. The main objective is to minimize the reprojection loss of keypoints, which allows our model to be trained using in-the-wild images that only have ground truth 2D annotations. However, the reprojection loss alone is highly underconstrained. In this work we address this problem by introducing an adversary trained to tell whether human body shape and pose are real or not using a large database of 3D human meshes. We show that HMR can be trained with and without using any paired 2D-to-3D supervision. We do not rely on intermediate 2D keypoint detections and infer 3D pose and shape parameters directly from image pixels. Our model runs in real-time given a bounding box containing the person. We demonstrate our approach on various images in-the-wild and out-perform previous optimization-based methods that output 3D meshes and show competitive results on tasks such as 3D joint location estimation and part segmentation.

5. Learning to estimate 3D human pose and shape from a single color image

   *CVPR, 2018* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Pavlakos_Learning_to_Estimate_CVPR_2018_paper.html) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       This work addresses the problem of estimating the full body 3D human pose and shape from a single color image. This is a task where iterative optimization-based solutions have typically prevailed, while Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have suffered because of the lack of training data and their low resolution 3D predictions. Our work aims to bridge this gap and proposes an efficient and effective direct prediction method based on ConvNets. Central part to our approach is the incorporation of a parametric statistical body shape model (SMPL) within our end-to-end framework. This allows us to get very detailed 3D mesh results, while requiring estimation only of a small number of parameters, making it friendly for direct network prediction. Interestingly, we demonstrate that these parameters can be predicted reliably only from 2D keypoints and masks. These are typical outputs of generic 2D human analysis ConvNets, allowing us to relax the massive requirement that images with 3D shape ground truth are available for training. Simultaneously, by maintaining differentiability, at training time we generate the 3D mesh from the estimated parameters and optimize explicitly for the surface using a 3D per-vertex loss. Finally, a differentiable renderer is employed to project the 3D mesh to the image, which enables further refinement of the network, by optimizing for the consistency of the projection with 2D annotations (i.e., 2D keypoints or masks). The proposed approach outperforms previous baselines on this task and offers an attractive solution for direct prediction of 3D shape from a single color image.

6. Densepose: Dense human pose estimation in the wild

   *CVPR, 2019* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Guler_DensePose_Dense_Human_CVPR_2018_paper.html) [[Code\]](http://densepose.org)

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       In this work we establish dense correspondences between an RGB image and a surface-based representation of the human body, a task we refer to as dense human pose estimation. We gather dense correspondences for 50K persons appearing in the COCO dataset by introducing an efficient annotation pipeline. We then use our dataset to train CNN-based systems that deliver dense correspondence "in the wild", namely in the presence of background, occlusions and scale variations. We improve our training set's effectiveness by training an inpainting network that can fill in missing ground truth values and report improvements with respect to the best results that would be achievable in the past. We experiment with fully-convolutional networks and region-based models and observe a superiority of the latter. We further improve accuracy through cascading, obtaining a system that delivers highly-accurate results at multiple frames per second on a single gpu. Supplementary materials, data, code, and videos are provided on the project page http://densepose.org.

7. GraphCMR: Convolutional mesh regression for single-image human shape reconstruction

   *CVPR, 2019* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Kolotouros_Convolutional_Mesh_Regression_for_Single-Image_Human_Shape_Reconstruction_CVPR_2019_paper.html) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose and shape estimation from a single image. Previous approaches consider a parametric model of the human body, SMPL, and attempt to regress the model parameters that give rise to a mesh consistent with image evidence. This parameter regression has been a very challenging task, with model-based approaches underperforming compared to nonparametric solutions in terms of pose estimation. In our work, we propose to relax this heavy reliance on the model's parameter space. We still retain the topology of the SMPL template mesh, but instead of predicting model parameters, we directly regress the 3D location of the mesh vertices. This is a heavy task for a typical network, but our key insight is that the regression becomes significantly easier using a Graph-CNN. This architecture allows us to explicitly encode the template mesh structure within the network and leverage the spatial locality the mesh has to offer. Image-based features are attached to the mesh vertices and the Graph-CNN is responsible to process them on the mesh structure, while the regression target for each vertex is its 3D location. Having recovered the complete 3D geometry of the mesh, if we still require a specific model parametrization, this can be reliably regressed from the vertices locations. We demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of our proposed graph-based mesh regression by attaching different types of features on the mesh vertices. In all cases, we outperform the comparable baselines relying on model parameter regression, while we also achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose estimation approaches.

8. Holopose: Holistic 3d human reconstruction in-the-wild

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       We introduce HoloPose, a method for holistic monocular 3D human body reconstruction. We first introduce a part-based model for 3D model parameter regression that allows our method to operate in-the-wild, gracefully handling severe occlusions and large pose variation. We further train a multi-task network comprising 2D, 3D and Dense Pose estimation to drive the 3D reconstruction task. For this we introduce an iterative refinement method that aligns the model-based 3D estimates of 2D/3D joint positions and DensePose with their image-based counterparts delivered by CNNs, achieving both model-based, global consistency and high spatial accuracy thanks to the bottom-up CNN processing. We validate our contributions on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method allows us to get both accurate joint and 3D surface estimates while operating at more than 10fps in-the-wild. More information about our approach, including videos and demos is available at http://arielai.com/holopose.

9. Learning 3d human dynamics from video

   *CVPR, 2019* [[Paper\]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Kanazawa_Learning_3D_Human_Dynamics_From_Video_CVPR_2019_paper.html) [[Code\]]()

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       From an image of a person in action, we can easily guess the 3D motion of the person in the immediate past and future. This is because we have a mental model of 3D human dynamics that we have acquired from observing visual sequences of humans in motion. We present a framework that can similarly learn a representation of 3D dynamics of humans from video via a simple but effective temporal encoding of image features. At test time, from video, the learned temporal representation give rise to smooth 3D mesh predictions. From a single image, our model can recover the current 3D mesh as well as its 3D past and future motion. Our approach is designed so it can learn from videos with 2D pose annotations in a semi-supervised manner. Though annotated data is always limited, there are millions of videos uploaded daily on the Internet. In this work, we harvest this Internet-scale source of unlabeled data by training our model on unlabeled video with pseudo-ground truth 2D pose obtained from an off-the-shelf 2D pose detector. Our experiments show that adding more videos with pseudo-ground truth 2D pose monotonically improves 3D prediction performance. We evaluate our model on the recent challenging dataset of 3D Poses in the Wild and obtain state-of-the-art performance on the 3D prediction task without any fine-tuning.

10. Pose2Mesh: Graph Convolutional Network for 3D Human Pose and Mesh Recovery from a 2D Human Pose

   *ECCV, 2020* [[Paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09047) [[Code\]](https://github.com/hongsukchoi/Pose2Mesh_RELEASE)

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Most of the recent deep learning-based 3D human pose and mesh estimation methods regress the pose and shape parameters of human mesh models, such as SMPL and MANO, from an input image. The first weakness of these methods is an appearance domain gap problem, due to different image appearance between train data from controlled environments, such as a laboratory, and test data from in-the-wild environments. The second weakness is that the estimation of the pose parameters is quite challenging owing to the representation issues of 3D rotations. To overcome the above weaknesses, we propose Pose2Mesh, a novel graph convolutional neural network (GraphCNN)-based system that estimates the 3D coordinates of human mesh vertices directly from the 2D human pose. The 2D human pose as input provides essential human body articulation information, while having a relatively homogeneous geometric property between the two domains. Also, the proposed system avoids the representation issues, while fully exploiting the mesh topology using a GraphCNN in a coarse-to-fine manner. We show that our Pose2Mesh outperforms the previous 3D human pose and mesh estimation methods on various benchmark datasets.

       We propose a novel algorithm for the fitting of 3D human shape to images. Combining the accuracy and refinement capabilities of iterative gradient-based optimization techniques with the robustness of deep neural networks, we propose a gradient descent algorithm that leverages a neural network to predict the parameter update rule for each iteration. This per-parameter and state-aware update guides the optimizer towards a good solution in very few steps, converging in typically few steps. During training our approach only requires MoCap data of human poses, parametrized via SMPL. From this data the network learns a subspace of valid poses and shapes in which optimization is performed much more efficiently. The approach does not require any hard to acquire image-to-3D correspondences. At test time we only optimize the 2D joint re-projection error without the need for any further priors or regularization terms. We show empirically that this algorithm is fast (avg. 120ms convergence), robust to initialization and dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results on public evaluation datasets including the challenging 3DPW in-the-wild benchmark (improvement over SMPLify 45%) and also approaches using image-to-3D correspondences

12. Hierarchical Kinematic Human Mesh Recovery

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       We consider the problem of estimating a parametric model of 3D human mesh from a single image. While there has been substantial recent progress in this area with direct regression of model parameters, these methods only implicitly exploit the human body kinematic structure, leading to sub-optimal use of the model prior. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a new technique for regression of human parametric model that is explicitly informed by the known hierarchical structure, including joint interdependencies of the model. This results in a strong prior-informed design of the regressor architecture and an associated hierarchical optimization that is flexible to be used in conjunction with the current standard frameworks for 3D human mesh recovery. We demonstrate these aspects by means of extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, showing how our proposed new design outperforms several existing and popular methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results. By considering joint interdependencies, our method is equipped to infer joints even under data corruptions, which we demonstrate by conducting experiments under varying degrees of occlusion.

       Human motion is fundamental to understanding behavior. Despite progress on single-image 3D pose and shape estimation, existing video-based state-of-the-art methods fail to produce accurate and natural motion sequences due to a lack of ground-truth 3D motion data for training. To address this problem, we propose "Video Inference for Body Pose and Shape Estimation" (VIBE), which makes use of an existing large-scale motion capture dataset (AMASS) together with unpaired, in-the-wild, 2D keypoint annotations. Our key novelty is an adversarial learning framework that leverages AMASS to discriminate between real human motions and those produced by our temporal pose and shape regression networks. We define a novel temporal network architecture with a self-attention mechanism and show that adversarial training, at the sequence level, produces kinematically plausible motion sequences without in-the-wild ground-truth 3D labels. We perform extensive experimentation to analyze the importance of motion and demonstrate the effectiveness of VIBE on challenging 3D pose estimation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE

       We develop a technique for generating smooth and accurate 3D human pose and motion estimates from RGB video sequences. Our technique, which we call Motion Estimation via Variational Autoencoder (MEVA), decomposes a temporal sequence of human motion into a smooth motion representation using auto-encoder-based motion compression and a residual representation learned through motion refinement. This two-step encoding process of human motion can represent a wide variety of general human motions while also retaining person-specific motion details. Experiments show that our method produces both smooth and accurate 3D human pose and motion estimates.

       Recovering 3D human pose from 2D joints is a highly unconstrained problem. We propose a novel neural network framework, PoseNet3D, that takes 2D joints as input and outputs 3D skeletons and SMPL body model parameters. By casting our learning approach in a student-teacher framework, we avoid using any 3D data such as paired/unpaired 3D data, motion capture sequences, depth images or multi-view images during training. We first train a teacher network that outputs 3D skeletons, using only 2D poses for training. The teacher network distills its knowledge to a student network that predicts 3D pose in SMPL representation. Finally, both the teacher and the student networks are jointly fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner using temporal, self-consistency and adversarial losses, improving the accuracy of each individual network. Results on Human3.6M dataset for 3D human pose estimation demonstrate that our approach reduces the 3D joint prediction error by 18% compared to previous unsupervised methods. Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets show that the recovered 3D poses and meshes are natural, realistic, and flow smoothly over consecutive frames.

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       This paper addresses the problem of monocular 3D human shape and pose estimation from an RGB image. Despite great progress in this field in terms of pose prediction accuracy, state-of-the-art methods often predict inaccurate body shapes. We suggest that this is primarily due to the scarcity of in-the-wild training data with diverse and accurate body shape labels. Thus, we propose STRAPS (Synthetic Training for Real Accurate Pose and Shape), a system that utilises proxy representations, such as silhouettes and 2D joints, as inputs to a shape and pose regression neural network, which is trained with synthetic training data (generated on-the-fly during training using the SMPL statistical body model) to overcome data scarcity. We bridge the gap between synthetic training inputs and noisy real inputs, which are predicted by keypoint detection and segmentation CNNs at test-time, by using data augmentation and corruption during training. In order to evaluate our approach, we curate and provide a challenging evaluation dataset for monocular human shape estimation, Sports Shape and Pose 3D (SSP-3D). It consists of RGB images of tightly-clothed sports-persons with a variety of body shapes and corresponding pseudo-ground-truth SMPL shape and pose parameters, obtained via multi-frame optimisation. We show that STRAPS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on SSP-3D in terms of shape prediction accuracy, while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art on pose-centric datasets and metrics.

   <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Whole-body 3D human mesh estimation aims to reconstruct the 3D human body, hands, and face simultaneously. Although several methods have been proposed, accurate prediction of 3D hands, which consist of 3D wrist and fingers, still remains challenging due to two reasons. First, the human kinematic chain has not been carefully considered when predicting the 3D wrists. Second, previous works utilize body features for the 3D fingers, where the body feature barely contains finger information. To resolve the limitations, we present Hand4Whole, which has two strong points over previous works. First, we design Pose2Pose, a module that utilizes joint features for 3D joint rotations. Using Pose2Pose, Hand4Whole utilizes hand MCP joint features to predict 3D wrists as MCP joints largely contribute to 3D wrist rotations in the human kinematic chain. Second, Hand4Whole discards the body feature when predicting 3D finger rotations. Our Hand4Whole is trained in an end-to-end manner and produces much better 3D hand results than previous whole-body 3D human mesh estimation methods.

       Capturing the dynamically deforming 3D shape of clothed human is essential for numerous applications, including VR/AR, autonomous driving, and human-computer interaction. Existing methods either require a highly specialized capturing setup, such as expensive multi-view imaging systems, or they lack robustness to challenging body poses. In this work, we propose a method capable of capturing the dynamic 3D human shape from a monocular video featuring challenging body poses, without any additional input. We first build a 3D template human model of the subject based on a learned regression model. We then track this template model's deformation under challenging body articulations based on 2D image observations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on an in-the-wild human video dataset 3DPW. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in robustness and generalizability on videos from iPER datasets.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       We present KAMA, a 3D Keypoint Aware Mesh Articulation approach that allows us to estimate a human body mesh from the positions of 3D body keypoints. To this end, we learn to estimate 3D positions of 26 body keypoints and propose an analytical solution to articulate a parametric body model, SMPL, via a set of straightforward geometric transformations. Since keypoint estimation directly relies on image clues, our approach offers significantly better alignment to image content when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed approach does not require any paired mesh annotations and is able to achieve state-of-the-art mesh fittings through 3D keypoint regression only. Results on the challenging 3DPW and Human3.6M demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art body mesh fittings.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       The ability to estimate 3D human shape and pose from images can be useful in many contexts.
Recent approaches have explored using graph convolutional networks, and achieved promising results. The fact that the 3D shape is represented by a mesh, an undirected graph, makes graph convolutional networks a natural fit for this problem. However, graph convolutional networks have limited representation power. Information from nodes in the graph is passed to connected neighbors, and propagation of information requires successive graph convolutions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-scale graph approach. We use a coarse graph, derived from a dense graph, to estimate the human’s 3D pose, and the dense graph to estimate the 3D shape. Information in coarse graphs can be propagated over longer distances compared to dense graphs. In addition, information about pose can guide to recover local shape detail, and vice versa. We recognize that the connection between coarse and dense is itself a graph, and introduce graph fusion blocks to exchange information between graphs with different scales. We train our model end-to-end and show that we can achieve state of the art results for several evaluation datasets.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Differently from 2D image datasets such as COCO, largescale human datasets with 3D ground-truth annotations are very difficult to obtain in the wild. In this paper, we address this problem by augmenting existing 2D datasets with high-quality 3D pose fits. Remarkably, the resulting annotations are sufficient to train from scratch 3D pose regressor networks that outperform the current state-of-the-art on in the-wild benchmarks such as 3DPW. Additionally, training on our augmented data is straightforward as it does not require to mix multiple and incompatible 2D and 3D datasets or to use complicated network architectures and training procedures. This simplified pipeline affords additional improvements, including injecting extreme crop augmentations to better reconstruct highly truncated people, and incorporating auxiliary inputs to improve 3D pose estimation accuracy. It also reduces the dependency on 3D datasets such as H36M that have restrictive licenses. We also use our method to introduce new benchmarks for the study of real-world challenges such as occlusions, truncations, and rare body poses. In order to obtain such high quality 3D pseudo-annotations, inspired by progress in internal learning, we introduce Exemplar Fine-Tuning (EFT). EFT combines the re-projection accuracy of fitting methods like SMPLify with a 3D pose prior implicitly captured by a pre-trained 3D pose regressor network. We show that EFT produces 3D annotations that result in better downstream performance and are qualitatively preferable in an extensive human-based assessment.

       In this paper, we decouple unsupervised human mesh recovery into the well-studied problems of unsupervised 3D pose estimation, and human mesh recovery from estimated 3D skeletons, focusing on the latter task. The challenges of the latter task are two folds: (1) pose failure (i.e., pose mismatching -- different skeleton definitions in dataset and SMPL , and pose ambiguity -- endpoints have arbitrary joint angle configurations for the same 3D joint coordinates). (2) shape ambiguity (i.e., the lack of shape constraints on body configuration). To address these issues, we propose Skeleton2Mesh, a novel lightweight framework that recovers human mesh from a single image. Our Skeleton2Mesh contains three modules, i.e., Differentiable Inverse Kinematics (DIK), Pose Refinement (PR) and Shape Refinement (SR) modules. DIK is designed to transfer 3D rotation from estimated 3D skeletons, which relies on a minimal set of kinematics prior knowledge. Then PR and SR modules are utilized to tackle the pose ambiguity and shape ambiguity respectively. All three modules can be incorporated into Skeleton2Mesh seamlessly via an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we utilize an adaptive joint regressor to alleviate the effects of skeletal topology from different datasets. Results on the Human3.6M dataset for human mesh recovery demonstrate that our method improves upon the previous unsupervised methods by 32.6% under the same setting. Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets exhibit that the recovered 3D meshes are natural, realistic. Our project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/skeleton2mesh.

Our novel transformer-based prediction pipeline can focus on image regions relevant to the task, supports self-supervised regimes, and ensures that solutions are consistent with human anthropometry. We show state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and 3DPW, for both the fully-supervised and the self-supervised models, for the task of inferring 3d human shape, joint positions, and global translation.

       Despite the recent success of 3D human reconstruction methods, recovering the accurate and smooth 3D human motion from video is still challenging. Designing a temporal model in the encoding stage is not sufficient enough to settle the trade-off problem between the per-frame accuracy and the motion smoothness. To address this problem, we approach some of the fundamental problems of 3D reconstruction tasks, simultaneously predicting 3D pose and 3D motion dynamics. First, we utilize the power of uncertainty to address the problem of multiple 3D configurations resulting in the same 2D projections. Second, we confirmed that dividing the body into local regions shows outstanding results for estimating 3D motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose (i) an encoder that makes two different estimations: a static feature that presents 2D pose feature as distribution and a dynamic feature that includes optical flow information and (ii) a decoder that divides the body into five different local regions to estimate the 3D motion dynamics of each region. We demonstrate how our method recovers the accurate and smooth motion and achieves the state-of-the-art results for both constrained and in-the-wild videos.

       We present a graph-convolution-reinforced transformer, named Mesh Graphormer, for 3D human pose and mesh reconstruction from a single image. Recently both transformers and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have shown promising progress in human mesh reconstruction. Transformer-based approaches are effective in modeling non-local interactions among 3D mesh vertices and body joints, whereas GCNNs are good at exploiting neighborhood vertex interactions based on a pre-specified mesh topology. In this paper, we study how to combine graph convolutions and self-attentions in a transformer to model both local and global interactions.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       3D human shape and pose estimation is the essential task for human motion analysis, which is widely used in many 3D applications. However, existing methods cannot simultaneously capture the relations at multiple levels, including spatial-temporal level and human joint level. Therefore they fail to make accurate predictions in some hard scenarios when there is cluttered background, occlusion, or extreme pose. To this end, we propose Multi-level Attention Encoder-Decoder Network (MAED), including a Spatial-Temporal Encoder (STE) and a Kinematic Topology Decoder (KTD) to model multi-level attentions in a unified framework. STE consists of a series of cascaded blocks based on Multi-Head Self-Attention, and each block uses two parallel branches to learn spatial and temporal attention respectively. Meanwhile, KTD aims at modeling the joint level attention. It regards pose estimation as a top-down hierarchical process similar to SMPL kinematic tree. With the training set of 3DPW, MAED outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 6.2, 7.2, and 2.4 mm of PA-MPJPE on the three widely used benchmarks 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M respectively.

       This paper focuses on the problem of 3D human reconstruction from 2D evidence. Although this is an inherently ambiguous problem, the majority of recent works avoid the uncertainty modeling and typically regress a single estimate for a given input. In contrast to that, in this work, we propose to embrace the reconstruction ambiguity and we recast the problem as learning a mapping from the input to a distribution of plausible 3D poses. Our approach is based on the normalizing flows model and offers a series of advantages. For conventional applications, where a single 3D estimate is required, our formulation allows for efficient mode computation. Using the mode leads to performance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic unimodal regression models. Simultaneously, since we have access to the likelihood of each sample, we demonstrate that our model is useful in a series of downstream tasks, where we leverage the probabilistic nature of the prediction as a tool for more accurate estimation. These tasks include reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views, as well as human model fitting, where our model acts as a powerful image-based prior for mesh recovery. Our results validate the importance of probabilistic modeling, and indicate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of settings.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       This paper addresses the problem of 3D human body shape and pose estimation from an RGB image. This is often an ill-posed problem, since multiple plausible 3D bodies may match the visual evidence present in the input - particularly when the subject is occluded. Thus, it is desirable to estimate a distribution over 3D body shape and pose conditioned on the input image instead of a single 3D reconstruction. We train a deep neural network to estimate a hierarchical matrix-Fisher distribution over relative 3D joint rotation matrices (i.e. body pose), which exploits the human body's kinematic tree structure, as well as a Gaussian distribution over SMPL body shape parameters. To further ensure that the predicted shape and pose distributions match the visual evidence in the input image, we implement a differentiable rejection sampler to impose a reprojection loss between ground-truth 2D joint coordinates and samples from the predicted distributions, projected onto the image plane. We show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of 3D shape and pose metrics on the SSP-3D and 3DPW datasets, while also yielding a structured probability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, with which we can meaningfully quantify prediction uncertainty and sample multiple plausible 3D reconstructions to explain a given input image.

       Despite significant progress, we show that state of the art 3D human pose and shape estimation methods remain sensitive to partial occlusion and can produce dramatically wrong predictions although much of the body is observable. To address this, we introduce a soft attention mechanism, called the Part Attention REgressor (PARE), that learns to predict body-part-guided attention masks. We observe that state-of-the-art methods rely on global feature representations, making them sensitive to even small occlusions. In contrast, PARE's part-guided attention mechanism overcomes these issues by exploiting information about the visibility of individual body parts while leveraging information from neighboring body-parts to predict occluded parts. We show qualitatively that PARE learns sensible attention masks, and quantitative evaluation confirms that PARE achieves more accurate and robust reconstruction results than existing approaches on both occlusion-specific and standard benchmarks.

       People touch their face 23 times an hour, they cross their arms and legs, put their hands on their hips, etc. While many images of people contain some form of self-contact, current 3D human pose and shape (HPS) regression methods typically fail to estimate this contact. To address this, we develop new datasets and methods that significantly improve human pose estimation with self-contact. First, we create a dataset of 3D Contact Poses (3DCP) containing SMPL-X bodies fit to 3D scans as well as poses from AMASS, which we refine to ensure good contact. Second, we leverage this to create the Mimic-The-Pose (MTP) dataset of images, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing people mimicking the 3DCP poses with self-contact. Third, we develop a novel HPS optimization method, SMPLify-XMC, that includes contact constraints and uses the known 3DCP body pose during fitting to create near ground-truth poses for MTP images. Fourth, for more image variety, we label a dataset of in-the-wild images with Discrete Self-Contact (DSC) information and use another new optimization method, SMPLify-DC, that exploits discrete contacts during pose optimization. Finally, we use our datasets during SPIN training to learn a new 3D human pose regressor, called TUCH (Towards Understanding Contact in Humans). We show that the new self-contact training data significantly improves 3D human pose estimates on withheld test data and existing datasets like 3DPW.

31. TCMR: Beyond static features for temporally consistent 3d human pose and shape from a video

       Despite the recent success of single image-based 3D human pose and shape estimation methods, recovering temporally consistent and smooth 3D human motion from a video is still challenging. Several video-based methods have been proposed; however, they fail to resolve the single image-based methods' temporal inconsistency issue due to a strong dependency on a static feature of the current frame. In this regard, we present a temporally consistent mesh recovery system (TCMR). It effectively focuses on the past and future frames' temporal information without being dominated by the current static feature. Our TCMR significantly outperforms previous video-based methods in temporal consistency with better per-frame 3D pose and shape accuracy. We also release the codes.

32. Hybrik: A hybrid analytical-neural inverse kinematics solution for 3d human pose and shape estimation

       Model-based 3D pose and shape estimation methods reconstruct a full 3D mesh for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/HybrIK.

33. Learning to regress bodies from images using differentiable semantic rendering

       Learning to regress 3D human body shape and pose (e.g. SMPL parameters) from monocular images typically exploits losses on 2D keypoints, silhouettes, and/or part-segmentation when 3D training data is not available. Such losses, however, are limited because 2D keypoints do not supervise body shape and segmentations of people in clothing do not match projected minimally-clothed SMPL shapes. To exploit richer image information about clothed people, we introduce higher-level semantic information about clothing to penalize clothed and non-clothed regions of the image differently. To do so, we train a body regressor using a novel "Differentiable Semantic Rendering - DSR" loss. For Minimally-Clothed regions, we define the DSR-MC loss, which encourages a tight match between a rendered SMPL body and the minimally-clothed regions of the image. For clothed regions, we define the DSR-C loss to encourage the rendered SMPL body to be inside the clothing mask. To ensure end-to-end differentiable training, we learn a semantic clothing prior for SMPL vertices from thousands of clothed human scans. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the role of clothing semantics on the accuracy of 3D human pose and shape estimation. We outperform all previous state-of-the-art methods on 3DPW and Human3.6M and obtain on par results on MPI-INF-3DHP. Code and trained models will be available for research at https://dsr.is.tue.mpg.de/

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Existing deep learning-based human mesh reconstruction approaches have a tendency to build larger networks in order to achieve higher accuracy. Computational complexity and model size are often neglected, despite being key characteristics for practical use of human mesh reconstruction models (e.g. virtual try-on systems). In this paper, we present GTRS, a lightweight pose-based method that can reconstruct human mesh from 2D human pose. We propose a pose analysis module that uses graph transformers to exploit structured and implicit joint correlations, and a mesh regression module that combines the extracted pose feature with the mesh template to reconstruct the final human mesh. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of GTRS by extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. In particular, GTRS achieves better accuracy than the SOTA pose-based method Pose2Mesh while only using 10.2% of the parameters (Params) and 2.5% of the FLOPs on the challenging in-the-wild 3DPW dataset.

       3D human pose and shape recovery from a monocular RGB image is a challenging task. Existing learning based methods highly depend on weak supervision signals, e.g. 2D and 3D joint location, due to the lack of in-the-wild paired 3D supervision. However, considering the 2D-to-3D ambiguities existed in these weak supervision labels, the network is easy to get stuck in local optima when trained with such labels. In this paper, we reduce the ambituity by optimizing multiple initializations. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework named Multi-Initialization Optimization Network (MION). In the first stage, we strategically select different coarse 3D reconstruction candidates which are compatible with the 2D keypoints of input sample. Each coarse reconstruction can be regarded as an initialization leads to one optimization branch. In the second stage, we design a mesh refinement transformer (MRT) to respectively refine each coarse reconstruction result via a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a Consistency Estimation Network (CEN) is proposed to find the best result from mutiple candidates by evaluating if the visual evidence in RGB image matches a given 3D reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our Multi-Initialization Optimization Network outperforms existing 3D mesh based methods on multiple public benchmarks.

       Learning to capture human motion is essential to 3D human pose and shape estimation from monocular video. However, the existing methods mainly rely on recurrent or convolutional operation to model such temporal information, which limits the ability to capture non-local context relations of human motion. To address this problem, we propose a motion pose and shape network (MPS-Net) to effectively capture humans in motion to estimate accurate and temporally coherent 3D human pose and shape from a video. Specifically, we first propose a motion continuity attention (MoCA) module that leverages visual cues observed from human motion to adaptively recalibrate the range that needs attention in the sequence to better capture the motion continuity dependencies. Then, we develop a hierarchical attentive feature integration (HAFI) module to effectively combine adjacent past and future feature representations to strengthen temporal correlation and refine the feature representation of the current frame. By coupling the MoCA and HAFI modules, the proposed MPS-Net excels in estimating 3D human pose and shape in the video. Though conceptually simple, our MPS-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmark datasets, but also uses fewer network parameters. The video demos can be found at https://mps-net.github.io/MPS-Net/.

37. Occluded human mesh recovery

       Top-down methods for monocular human mesh recovery have two stages: (1) detect human bounding boxes; (2) treat each bounding box as an independent single-human mesh recovery task. Unfortunately, the single-human assumption does not hold in images with multi-human occlusion and crowding. Consequently, top-down methods have difficulties in recovering accurate 3D human meshes under severe person-person occlusion. To address this, we present Occluded Human Mesh Recovery (OCHMR) - a novel top-down mesh recovery approach that incorporates image spatial context to overcome the limitations of the single-human assumption. The approach is conceptually simple and can be applied to any existing top-down architecture. Along with the input image, we condition the top-down model on spatial context from the image in the form of body-center heatmaps. To reason from the predicted body centermaps, we introduce Contextual Normalization (CoNorm) blocks to adaptively modulate intermediate features of the top-down model. The contextual conditioning helps our model disambiguate between two severely overlapping human bounding-boxes, making it robust to multi-person occlusion. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, OCHMR achieves superior performance on challenging multi-person benchmarks like 3DPW, CrowdPose, and OCHuman. Specifically, our proposed contextual reasoning architecture applied to the SPIN model with ResNet-50 backbone results in 75.2 PMPJPE on 3DPW-PC, 23.6 AP on CrowdPose, and 37.7 AP on OCHuman datasets, a significant improvement of 6.9 mm, 6.4 AP, and 20.8 AP respectively over the baseline. Code and models will be released.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Reconstructing multi-human body mesh from a single monocular image is an important but challenging computer vision problem. In addition to the individual body mesh models, we need to estimate relative 3D positions among subjects to generate a coherent representation. In this work, through a single graph neural network, named MUG (Multi-hUman Graph network), we construct coherent multi-human meshes using only multi-human 2D pose as input. Compared with existing methods, which adopt a detection-style pipeline (i.e., extracting image features and then locating human instances and recovering body meshes from that) and suffer from the significant domain gap between lab-collected training datasets and in-the-wild testing datasets, our method benefits from the 2D pose which has a relatively consistent geometric property across datasets. Our method works like the following: First, to model the multi-human environment, it processes multi-human 2D poses and builds a novel heterogeneous graph, where nodes from different people and within one person are connected to capture inter-human interactions and draw the body geometry (i.e., skeleton and mesh structure). Second, it employs a dual-branch graph neural network structure -- one for predicting inter-human depth relation and the other one for predicting root-joint-relative mesh coordinates. Finally, the entire multi-human 3D meshes are constructed by combining the output from both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG outperforms previous multi-human mesh estimation methods on standard 3D human benchmarks -- Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       Reconstructing a 3D human body mesh from a monocular image is a challenging inverse problem because of occlusion and complicated human articulations. Recent deep learning-based methods have made significant progress in single-image human reconstruction. Most of these works are either model-based methods, which estimate the sparse parameters of a statistical human body model, or model-free methods, which directly recover the vertices' coordinates of a predefined mesh. However, model-based methods always suffer detail losses due to the limited parameter space, and model-free methods are hard to directly recover satisfactory results from images due to the use of a shared global feature for all vertices and the domain gap between 2D regular images and 3D irregular meshes. To resolve these issues, we propose a hybrid model, which combines the advantages of both model-based approach and model-free approach to estimate a 3D human mesh in a coarse-to-fine manner. Initially, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the parameters of a Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL), which allows us to generate a coarse human mesh. After that, the vertex coordinates of the coarse human mesh are further refined by a graph convolutional neural network (GCN). Unlike previous GCN-based methods, whose vertex coordinates are recovered from a shared global feature, we propose a LOcal CorRespondence-Aware (LOCRA) module to extract local special features for each vertex. To make the local features related to the human pose, we also add a keypoint-related loss to supervise the training process of the LOCRA module. Experiments demonstrate that our hybrid model with the LOCRA module outperforms existing methods on multiple public benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
       A key challenge in the task of human pose and shape estimation is occlusion, including self-occlusions, object-human occlusions, and inter-person occlusions. The lack of diverse and accurate pose and shape training data becomes a major bottleneck, especially for scenes with occlusions in the wild. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of human pose and shape in the case of inter-person occlusions, while also handling object-human occlusions and self-occlusion. We propose a novel framework that synthesizes occlusion-aware silhouette and 2D keypoints data and directly regress to the SMPL pose and shape parameters. A neural 3D mesh renderer is exploited to enable silhouette supervision on the fly, which contributes to great improvements in shape estimation. In addition, keypoints-and-silhouette-driven training data in panoramic viewpoints are synthesized to compensate for the lack of viewpoint diversity in any existing dataset. Experimental results show that we are among the state-of-the-art on the 3DPW and 3DPW-Crowd datasets in terms of pose estimation accuracy. The proposed method evidently outperforms Mesh Transformer, 3DCrowdNet and ROMP in terms of shape estimation. Top performance is also achieved on SSP-3D in terms of shape prediction accuracy. Demo and code will be available at https://igame-lab.github.io/LASOR/ .
